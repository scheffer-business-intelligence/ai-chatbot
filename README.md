## Model Providers

This project supports three model paths in the same UI:

- `google/scheffer-agent-engine` via Vertex AI Agent Engine (service account auth).
- Gemini models via direct Google API (`GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`).
- GPT models via direct OpenAI API (`OPENAI_API_KEY`).

`AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` is optional and only needed if you decide to use Vercel AI Gateway-routed models.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of the Next.js AI Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/nextjs-ai-chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js AI Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

### Google ADK Agent Engine model

To use the `Scheffer Agent Engine` model in the UI, also configure:

- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE` (for example `bi-scheffer.json`)
- `VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`
- `VERTEX_LOCATION`
- `VERTEX_REASONING_ENGINE`

The backend uses the service account file to obtain the Vertex access token.

To use direct Gemini and GPT models in the selector, also configure:

- `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY`
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate # Setup database or apply latest database changes
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
